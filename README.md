# Graduation-Project

SeedIT is an innovative mobile application that uses artificial intelligence and a recommendation system to help users get the best plants to seed in a suitable location, 
using the camera on the user's device to detect the place.

Our goal is to solve the problems of unutilized spaces, lack of agriculture experience, and lack of vegetation areas by providing users with a tool to enhance their
agriculture knowledge and utilize unused spaces in a sustainable manner.

The app will provide recommendations based on the date, lighting, and other factors present at that specific location. In addition to the recommendation system, 
SeedIT offers a community forum where users can connect with other gardening enthusiasts and share their experiences and knowledge.

In this project, I was responsible for designing and implementing the backend business logic and database management using ASP.NET Core web API and MySQL DBMS.
I followed the Onion architecture for designing the application, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. To enhance the security of the application, 
I employed JWT tokens for user authentication and refresh tokens for token validation. Additionally, I implemented various security measures, 
such as encryption and secure storage, to ensure the integrity of the tokens.
